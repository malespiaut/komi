Compilation on Windows via MinGW and msys is known to work. But you must:

  * Install the SDL and SDL_Mixer development files.

  * Alter the Makefile so that you have:
      DATAPATH=komidata/
    instead of:
      DATAPATH=/usr/local/share/komidata/

  * Have in your path the program sdl-config. This seems to be distributed in the SDL
    development libraries for MinGW as i386-mingw32msvc-sdl-config so you'll need to
    rename it.

  * Run make with msys.

  * Once compiled, you may need to add the SDL.dll and SDL_mixer.dll files to the
    directory the komi application is in.

In my rather unscientific test, the Windows version seemed to be quite a bit slower than the Linux version. Is it OK for you on Windows? Email me feedback to acrossman@users.sourceforge.net
