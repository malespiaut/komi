This version is a beta-release. The game may not be feature complete. Still, it is playable. The main motive for the release is so I can get bug-reports and reports of whether it compiles correctly on your platform. Please email acrossman@users.sourceforge.net with such reports. Thanks.

The aim of the game is to collect the money (in the forms of coins and diamonds) floating about the screen. Move Komi (the Space Frog) with the arrow keys and extend his tongue with the spacebar.
