This version is an alpha-release. The game is not feature complete. Still, it is playable. The main motive for the release is so I can get bug-reports and reports of whether it compiles correctly on your platform. Please email acrossman@users.sourceforge.net with such reports. Thanks.

The aim of the game is to collect the money (in the forms of coins and diamonds) floating about the screen. Move Komi (the Space Frog) with the arrow keys and extend his tongue with the spacebar.

For the future, I plan to have some powerups which Komi can snag that (for example) allow him to shoot a few shots back at the enemies. I also hope to implement a much faster way of drawing to the screen which will hopefully reduce the minumum required specs to play the game.
