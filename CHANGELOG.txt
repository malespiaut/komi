From 1.03 to 1.04
-----------------

* Clean up totally atrocious lightning code, which was using 3 almost-identical functions.
* Print last score for session at titlebar when in main menu.
* Test for direct collision between Komi and electras' lightning. Shouldn't matter much.
* Actually check that the virtual screen got created before trying to use it (ie check it ain't == NULL)
* Report DATAPATH when sent -v or -h command-line options.
* Reduce amount of money in levels > 30.

From 1.02 to 1.03
-----------------

* For compatibility, remove use of snprintf() which seems to be a C99 specific function.
* --gfxdetails argument will print some details about the SDL surfaces.
* It will also print FPS information when possible.
* Makefile does install -d for the BINPATH
* All enemies now can be in algorithmically generated (non-predefined) levels.
* If reached via normal game, algorithmic generation of levels starts with easier levels.

From 1.01 to 1.02
-----------------

* Fix a couple of syntax errors that showed up on Mac OS 9 in MPW.
* Remove --shuffle command line option in favour of clickable button in menu.
* Save shuffle choice to ~/.komirc

From 1.0 to 1.01
----------------

* Save prefs file (now called ".komirc") into home directory, if possible. Thanks to Steve Kemp.

From 0.95b to 1.0
-----------------

* Removed last uses of direct pixel access without locking.
* rect() has thus been entirely removed.
* line() only called after surface locked.
* Added Bomber enemy type.
* Proper behaviour if player presses escape while screen is fading out after death or level completion.
* Levels defined up to 30.
* Added Sniper enemy type (first appearance is level 16).
* More level changes.

From 0.9b to 0.95b
------------------
* Screenshot key moved to F12. Successful generation of screenshot plays a sound.
* Q and W keys now move Komi left and right (for left handers).
* Return key now extends tongue.
* Failure to fully initialise keymap struct fixed.
* Use SDL_UpdateRect instead of SDL_Flip.
* Some level changes.
* Create empty "prefs" file on installation, with read-write permissions for all.
* Fixed issue where lasergun sounds wouldn't play if level was frozen, because the call to the sound-playing code was in the wrong place.
* Level freeze affects enemy shots.
* No high score when cheating.
* Track actual mouse position. Use this for highlighted buttons in main menu.
* Music infrastructure partially added, but no music is played yet...
* More level fiddling, some levels moved about.
* Collision detection slightly more liberal with the coins and diamonds.
* Add --shuffle option for the levels.
* Made --hog option undocumented. It actually seems to make things worse, often.
* Using SDL_Surfaces to store the sprites, and SDL_BlitSurface() to draw them. Gives me about a 15% speedup.
* Lock surfaces before directly accessing pixels, if required.

From 0.8b to 0.9b
-----------------
* Increased sound buffer size from 512 to 2048 - may prevent scratching observed on Windows.
* Fixed a few possible buffer overflows introduced by sprintf() and strcat(). Thanks to Steve Kemp.
* More complete acknowledgements in the title screen.
* Level 7 was too hard - reduced enemies by 1. Still hard, but doable with a bit of patience.
* Now save the speed setting in "prefs".
* Man page by Steve Kemp.
* Give audio warning of last life in fullscreen mode (since you can't see the display). Thanks to Amy Beeston.
* Save highscore in "prefs".
* Save prefs version in "prefs".

From 0.7b to 0.8b
-----------------
* Save screenshot to current directory instead of data directory.
* Added freeze and fast-tongue-retract powerups.
* Some changes in sprites.
* Added wrapball enemy type (though it's only in one level).
* Levels specifically defined up to level 28. If you get this far you are a God. :-)

From 0.6a to 0.7b
-----------------
* Added eyeball enemy type.
* Extra life every 1000 points.
* Added some comments to the code.
* Can now set delay between frames directly with "--delay 10" (for example).
* Can adjust speed directly in the title screen.

From 0.5a to 0.6a
-----------------
* Implemented "--fastdraw" option, which means only altered parts of the screen should get redrawn every frame.
* Implemented "--hog" option which refuses to give up the CPU mid-level.
* Changed shape of Komi's tongue so it looks a bit less phallic. Now looks oddly snake-like, but never mind. :-/
* Sprite collision optimised a bit - no checking bitmasks if sprites are obviously not touching due to their locations.
* Using Ulf Ekstrom's Bitmask 1.3 functions instead of 1.0.
* Removed #include for SDL-image since it wasn't being used.
* Added powerups.
