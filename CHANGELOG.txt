From 0.8b to 0.9b
-----------------

Increased sound buffer size from 512 to 2048 - may prevent scratching observed on Windows.

Fixed a few possible buffer overflows introduced by sprintf() and strcat(). Thanks to Steve Kemp.

More complete acknowledgements in the title screen.

Level 7 was too hard - reduced enemies by 1. Still hard, but doable with a bit of patience.

Now save the speed setting in "prefs".

Man page by Steve Kemp.

Give audio warning of last life in fullscreen mode (since you can't see the display). Thanks to Amy Beeston.

Save highscore in "prefs".

Save prefs version in "prefs".


From 0.7b to 0.8b
-----------------

Save screenshot to current directory instead of data directory.

Added freeze and fast-tongue-retract powerups.

Some changes in sprites.

Added wrapball enemy type (though it's only in one level).

Levels specifically defined up to level 28. If you get this far you are a God. :-)


From 0.6a to 0.7b
-----------------

Added eyeball enemy type.

Extra life every 1000 points.

Added some comments to the code.

Can now set delay between frames directly with "--delay 10" (for example).

Can adjust speed directly in the title screen.


From 0.5a to 0.6a
-----------------

Implemented "--fastdraw" option, which means only altered parts of the screen should get redrawn every frame.

Implemented "--hog" option which refuses to give up the CPU mid-level.

Changed shape of Komi's tongue so it looks a bit less phallic. :-/
Now looks oddly snake-like, but never mind.

Sprite collision optimised a bit - no checking bitmasks if sprites are obviously not touching due to their locations.

Using Ulf Ekstrom's Bitmask 1.3 functions instead of 1.0.

Removed #include for SDL-image since it wasn't being used.

Added powerups.
