From 0.5a to 0.6a
------------------

Implemented "--fastdraw" option, which means only altered parts of the screen should get redrawn every frame.

Implemented "--hog" option which refuses to give up the CPU mid-level.

Changed shape of Komi's tongue so it looks a bit less phallic. :-/
Now looks oddly snake-like, but never mind.

Sprite collision optimised a bit - no checking bitmasks if sprites are obviously not touching due to their locations.

Using Ulf Ekstrom's Bitmask 1.3 functions instead of 1.0.

Removed #include for SDL-image since it wasn't being used.

Added powerups.
