Komi installation:

Komi depends on SDL and SDL-mixer. You need these libraries for Komi to build.

See:

  http://www.libsdl.org/index.php             (for SDL)
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/   (for SDL-mixer)
  
On Gentoo, you can do:

  emerge libsdl
  emerge sdl-mixer

Once those libraries are installed, run (from the komi directory):

  make
  sudo make install

This will:

  * compile the app
  * place it in /usr/local/bin/
  * place the data files in /usr/local/share/komidata/

After this, you can run the game with the command:

  komi

The locations can be edited in the Makefile (do this before
compilation, so the app knows where to find the resources).

I'm really eager to hear about people's success or failure in
getting Komi to build; email feedback to
acrossman@users.sourceforge.net

Thanks.
