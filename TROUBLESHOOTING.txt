Troubleshooting Komi...


Sound Problems
--------------

Sound is by far my greatest problem in making Komi work properly. Under KDE, I often experience a segmentation fault. This seems to have something to do with the artsd sound system on KDE, which allows different applications to play sound at the same time, but seems to give grief to SDL, the media library which Komi uses.

Turning of the sound system in KDE and shutting down all other sound-using apps may possibly solve the problem, as might allowing the KDE sound system to timeout (which by default it does after a minute of inactivity).

But these are rather drastic steps. Komi can be played without sound, although the experience is not as enjoyable. Simply invoke komi like so from the command line:

  komi --nosound

I do wonder if this problem with KDE is just me though - for me it seems to affect even well known SDL games like frozen-bubble. YMMV. I normally use Fluxbox instead of KDE anyway. :-)


Speed Problems
--------------

The game may be too fast or too slow. Try invoking Komi with one of the following options:

  --fullspeed
  --superfast
  --fast
  --medium
  --slow
  --glacial

This is a rather weak way of programming speed control into a game - expect a more friendly interface to the speed controls in a future release.

The game runs fine on my computer, yet runs really slowly on a supposedly faster machine that I also have access to. The speed difference is about 400 percent. After investigation, this seems to have something to do with the second machine having hyperthreading. If you're running Komi on a hyperthreaded machine, I want to hear about your results.

As a last resort, try passing both the arguments --fastdraw and --fullspeed to Komi. The "--fastdraw" option is experimental but should update only those parts of the screen that need updating. It forces stars to be off.


Keys
----

For now, the keys can be edited only by modifying keys.h and recompiling. Expect a more friendly way in a future release...
